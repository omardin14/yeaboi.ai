"""Locate the sibling yeaboi repos a generator here writes into.

Some generators here cross the repo boundary, in both directions, because a
generator lives with the code it knows about while its output lives with the
surface that serves it:

* ``generate_graph_png.py`` and ``record_demo.py`` import yeaboi or drive its
  TUI, and write ``graph.png`` / ``demo.gif`` into the website.
* ``gen_duck_sprites.py`` and ``gen_mascot_sprites.py`` read the master duck art,
  which is a *served* asset of the website, and write renditions into this
  package and **yeaboi-frontend**.

None of them runs on a PR — their outputs are committed and guarded — so needing
a second checkout is a cost paid by whoever changes the product or the brand,
and never by CI.
