"""Record the README demo GIF deterministically — no human, no asciinema.

The old pipeline was a person running ``asciinema rec`` and typing through the
TUI live: keystroke timing, terminal geometry, the PyPI update check, and the
recorder's real ``~/.scrum-agent`` contents were all baked into the output, and
the ``.cast`` source was thrown away. This script replaces every one of those
variables:

- spawns ``yeaboi --dry-run`` in a pty pinned to 140x40 with a hermetic HOME
  (the exact recipe proven by ``tests/integration/test_tui_smoke.py``);
- drives a fixed key script, synchronized on rendered screen markers — never
  on sleeps — so the recording survives slow machines;
- writes the asciinema v2 ``.cast`` itself from the pty byte stream (agg reads
  the cast directly, so asciinema is not needed at all);
- renders the GIF with pinned agg flags and then *verifies* the result, failing
  loudly on blank/frozen frames or absurd durations. (The corruption that
  shipped before — garbled block-glyph titles full of U+FFFD — came from
  multibyte glyphs split across read chunks; CastWriter's incremental decoder
  makes that impossible.)

The recording is structurally deterministic (same screens, same keys, same
duration), not byte-identical — tips, shimmer and the duck animate off the wall
clock, which is accepted cosmetic variance.

POSIX-only (pty/termios), like the TUI itself.

Usage::

    uv run python scripts/record_demo.py                # record + render + verify
    uv run python scripts/record_demo.py --render-only  # re-render GIF from committed cast
    uv run python scripts/record_demo.py --check-only   # verify the existing cast + GIF

``verify()`` needs Pillow, which the dev venv gets transitively via matplotlib
(the ``charts`` extra); rendering needs ``agg`` (``brew install agg``).

#    both quick and machine-independent.

#    lone \x1b as Escape only when no second byte arrives within 100ms
#    (src/yeaboi/ui/shared/_input.py:158-165) — a key written straight after it
#    would be swallowed as an escape sequence. Every step following KEY_ESC
#    here is an `await`, i.e. a drained read far longer than 100ms.
