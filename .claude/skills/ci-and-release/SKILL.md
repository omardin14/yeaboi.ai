# CI, Versioning & Release

## Version Management

Version is **single-sourced in `pyproject.toml`** (`version = "…"`). `src/yeaboi/__init__.py` reads it at runtime from the installed package metadata (`importlib.metadata.version("yeaboi")`, with a `0.0.0+dev` fallback for uninstalled source trees). `__version__` is imported by `cli.py` for the `--version` flag. Package entry points: `yeaboi = "yeaboi.cli:main"` (canonical) and a one-release back-compat alias `scrum-agent = "yeaboi.cli:main"`. The PyPI distribution was renamed `scrum-agent` → `yeaboi`; a thin `scrum-agent` redirect package (`packaging/scrum-agent-shim/`) depends on `yeaboi` so existing installs migrate.

**Releasing is automatic on a version bump.** To ship a release: bump `version` in `pyproject.toml` (semver) and merge to `main`. On that push, `publish.yml` detects there's no `v<version>` tag yet and runs test → build → PyPI publish (OIDC) → creates the `v<version>` tag + GitHub Release. Merges that don't change the version are a no-op. Never tag manually — the workflow owns tagging.

**The bump itself is automated too (`auto-version.yml`).** On each PR, cheap deterministic guards run first (skip if the version was already changed in the PR, or if no `src/yeaboi/**` files changed and no `semver:*` label is present); otherwise Claude classifies the diff into a semver level and commits `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z [auto]` **to the PR branch** — so merging fires `publish.yml` with no manual step. Rules:
- **Bump on the PR branch, not `main`** — a workflow pushing to `main` with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not re-trigger `publish.yml` (recursion suppression); the human merge does. This means no PAT is needed.
- **Override with a label**: `semver:major` / `semver:minor` / `semver:patch` forces the level; `release:skip` (or `semver:none`) suppresses the bump.
- **Manual bumps still work** — if you edit `version` yourself, the guard sees it already differs from `main` and leaves it alone.
- **Mechanics** live in `scripts/bump_version.py` (pure `bump()` + `make bump-patch|bump-minor|bump-major`); the LLM only chooses the level.
- **Known limitation**: two PRs branched off the same version can pick the same next version — whichever merges second finds the tag already exists and won't publish separately. Acceptable for this repo; the fix (post-merge serialized bump on `main`) would need a PAT to re-trigger `publish.yml`.

Distribution is PyPI-only (via `uv tool install` / `pipx install`); Homebrew is not supported because a required dependency (`sqlite-vec`) ships no sdist, so the `omardin14/homebrew-tap` formula is permanently disabled.

## CI/CD

Workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ci.yml` | Every push | Lint + test |
| `auto-version.yml` | PR | Claude classifies the diff and commits a `chore: bump version…` to the PR branch (skips docs/chore-only PRs; `semver:*` / `release:skip` labels override) |
| `publish.yml` | Push to `main` | if `pyproject.toml` version has no tag yet: test → build → PyPI publish (OIDC) → tag + GitHub Release (else no-op) |
| `claude-review.yml` | CI workflow succeeds on a PR (`workflow_run`) | Async Claude code + security review comment; only fires when all CI checks passed (no tokens burned on red PRs); advisory only, never blocks merge (skips drafts, bots, and Dependabot PRs) |
| `dependabot-auto.yml` | CI workflow succeeds on a Dependabot PR (`workflow_run`) | Claude verifies each bump (release notes vs our actual usage), posts a `SAFE-TO-MERGE` / `NEEDS-HUMAN` verdict comment, and enables auto-merge for safe ones. Pip **majors** and minor+ bumps of TUI/agent-critical packages (`rich`, `sqlite-vec`, `langgraph`, `langchain*`, `anthropic`) always get the `needs-human` label instead. Auto-merge waits on the required checks, so nothing red can land |
| `smoke.yml` | Weekly cron | Live API smoke tests |
| `security-scan.yml` | Weekly cron + manual | SAST + dependency CVE audit on `main`; findings get a Claude fix PR (PRs get the same scan via ci.yml's `make security` job) |
| `claude.yml` | `@claude` mention, or `claude-implement` label on an issue | On-demand Claude Code assistance; the label triggers an implementation run that opens a PR |

Merge gating: the `main-branch` ruleset requires the five ci.yml checks (Unit tests, Integration & contract tests, Lint, Format check, Security scan) to pass before **any** PR can merge; auto-merge (enabled repo-wide) fires only when they're green. Golden evaluators stay non-blocking by design.

Dependabot notes: updates arrive **grouped** (one weekly PR per ecosystem; security updates grouped too — see `.github/dependabot.yml`). Pip Dependabot PRs carry the `semver:patch` label so merging one publishes a patch release — a merged dependency/CVE fix reaches PyPI users instead of sitting unreleased. Three mechanics to know:
- **Auth via `workflow_run`, not the Dependabot secret store.** Dependabot-triggered runs can only read a *separate* Dependabot secrets store, which the Claude GitHub App does **not** populate (it provisions `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` only into the *Actions* store). So `dependabot-auto.yml` triggers on `workflow_run` (after CI) instead of on Dependabot's `pull_request` event — a `workflow_run` job runs from the default branch with the normal Actions secrets, using the App's token directly. **No Dependabot secret needs to be created or kept in sync.** The PR is resolved from the CI run's head SHA; Claude derives the bumped packages from the PR title + diff (no `fetch-metadata`, which needs the avoided Dependabot context).
- **Labels must pre-exist.** Dependabot only *applies* labels that already exist in the repo — `dependencies`/`security`/`ci`/`semver:patch` are created; if one is deleted, Dependabot silently skips it.
- **Release trigger.** A merge performed by the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger `publish.yml` (same recursion suppression as the version bump), so an auto-merged pip bump's release simply defers to the next human push to `main` (an optional `AUTO_MERGE_TOKEN` PAT in the Actions store would make it publish immediately).

There is no Homebrew tap auto-update: the `omardin14/homebrew-tap` formula is disabled (see Version Management) and `publish.yml` no longer dispatches to it.

## Deployment (AWS Lightsail)

yeaboi is deployed on AWS Lightsail via the OpenClaw blueprint:
- OpenClaw comes pre-installed on the Lightsail instance
- Uses Amazon Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 4.6) via IAM instance role — no API key needed
- Bedrock IAM setup script: `curl -s https://d25b4yjpexuuj4.cloudfront.net/scripts/lightsail/setup-lightsail-openclaw-bedrock-role.sh | bash -s -- <instance-name> <region>`
- The setup wizard auto-detects the AWS region from `~/.aws/config` and the Bedrock model from OpenClaw's `models.json`
- See README section "Deploy on AWS Lightsail (OpenClaw)" for full guide
