# Delivery Report with yeaboi

1. **Pick the period.** Ask (or infer from the request) which window:
   `last_sprint`, `last_month`, or `quarter`.

2. **Generate.** Call `report_delivery` with that `period`. It pulls completed
   tickets from the configured tracker (Jira/Azure DevOps) and produces an
   executive narrative, outcome themes, metrics, and highlights.

3. **Present it stakeholder-ready.** Lead with the executive summary, then the
   themes with their delivered items, then metrics and highlights. Keep the
   language business-friendly — outcomes, not ticket numbers. Surface any
   `warnings` (no tracker configured, truncated results) so the user knows the
   coverage.

4. **Exports.** yeaboi auto-saves Markdown/HTML/slide-deck versions under
   `~/.yeaboi/exports/reporting/` — mention this when the user wants something
   to circulate or present.
