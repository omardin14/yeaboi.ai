name: standup
description: "Run a daily scrum standup with yeaboi: collect ticketing, code, and documentation activity, score sprint confidence, and summarize per member. Also reviews standup meeting transcripts to find what the report missed and why. Use when the user asks for a standup, daily scrum, 'what did the team do', a sprint progress check, or wants to check a standup report against a recording/transcript of the meeting."

# Daily Standup with yeaboi

1. **Run it.** Call `standup_run` (blank `session_id` targets the most recent
   planning session). Leave `deliver` false — you present the report; only set
   `deliver: true` if the user explicitly asks to send it to their configured
   channels (Slack/email/desktop). Pass `solo: true` when the user is running
   their own delivery with no team — one card, first-person summary.

2. **Present the report.** From `data`: lead with sprint day and the confidence
   score + rationale, then the team summary, then per-member updates (yesterday
   / today / blockers style), including each person's General Overview,
   `ticketing_summary`, `code_summary`, and `documentation_summary` with their
   category-specific links. Surface any `warnings` (e.g. a tracker returned
   401) — they explain missing sections.

   Each member may also carry `practices`: deterministic engineering-practice
   signals (work that landed with no ticket behind it, a board not updated after
   a merge, too many tickets held in progress, an oversized PR, commits with no
   PR, thin commit messages). **Present them as observations, never as
   judgements of the person** — each carries the evidence it was derived from,
   so quote the evidence and keep the framing coaching-shaped. They are computed
   by rule, not written by a model, so do not embellish, re-rank, or infer new
   ones; a `repeat: true` signal fired in the previous standup too. The
   report-level `practice_rollup` counts *members* per rule, not signals.

   Before a change is reported as untracked, it is matched against the
   description, acceptance criteria and definition of done of every ticket the
   team has open — a change that plausibly belongs to one is dropped silently,
   and the matched ticket is deliberately never recorded. So an `untracked-work`
   signal already means "we looked for a home for this and found none": do not
   soften it with a guess about which ticket it might belong to.

   **When the user says a signal was wrong, record it** with
   `standup_practice_feedback` (`member`, `rule`, `verdict='down'`, and a `note`
   capturing their reason in one sentence). That removes it from the stored
   report and stops every change behind it from ever being reported for that
   rule again — an open pull request would otherwise re-fire the same wrong
   nudge at the same person every morning. Use `verdict='up'` when they confirm
   a signal was right. Both feed the matching pass as calibration, which is why
   the note is worth writing. `applied: false` means the verdict was not
   recorded — that signal is no longer in the run (already voted on, or
   regenerated since), or it predates this feature and carries nothing to
   remember. Read the `reason` back to the user; do not retry.

3. **History.** For trends or "how have standups been going", call
   `standup_history` and summarize confidence over time.

4. **Check a standup against its meeting.** When the user has a transcript of
   the standup itself — or says the report missed something someone mentioned —
   call `standup_review`. It reads `.txt/.md/.vtt/.srt/.json` transcripts from
   `~/.yeaboi/transcripts` (or specific files via `transcript_paths`), checks
   what each person said they did against the evidence the report actually had,
   and diagnoses each gap. Present the two halves separately, because they need
   different actions:

   If the user pastes the transcript into the conversation, or you already have
   the text from a meeting-notes document, pass it as `transcript_text` — it is
   saved into `~/.yeaboi/transcripts` and reviewed like any other file. **Do not
   ask them to save it somewhere first.** Pass `standup_date` alongside it when
   the meeting was not today; for pasted text that date wins outright.
   - `gaps` are faults in yeaboi itself (a missing integration, a capability the
     collectors lack, a summary that dropped collected evidence). These are
     drafted as GitHub issues.
   - `config_suggestions` are the user's to fix and carry an exact `remedy`.
     They are never filed.

   **`file_issues` writes real, public GitHub issues** on the yeaboi repository.
   Never set it without asking the user first, and show them the gap titles
   before you do. The default drafts everything locally so it can be reviewed.
   Use `standup_gaps` to read back past reviews and see which gaps are already
   filed, which recurred, and their issue numbers.

   `standup_gaps` also returns `nudge` — the standups that ran but were never
   checked against their meeting. When `nudge.level` is set, say which dates went
   unchecked and offer to review a transcript for them. When it is `"escalated"`,
   the team has gone many standups without one: offer to turn the feature off
   (`transcript_review_enabled: false`) rather than asking again.

5. **Configuration.** To view or change the standup setup (time, weekdays,
   delivery channels, member aliases, user name, tracker sources, and selected
   team), use `standup_config_get` / `standup_config_set`. Call
   `standup_members` first to preview candidates from Jira, Azure DevOps, or
   both, and `standup_repositories` to discover GitHub repository/Azure project choices.
   Save an explicit `code_sources`, `github_owners`, `github_repositories`,
   `github_excluded_repositories`, and `azdo_projects` scope; a GitHub owner
   dynamically covers every active repository inside it (same as an Azure
   project), `github_excluded_repositories` (`owner/repo` slugs) opts specific
   repos back out of that expansion, and `github_repositories` pins exact
   repos regardless of owner scope. Save `documentation_sources` as a subset
   of `confluence`/`notion`; documentation files in selected repositories are
   included automatically. The selected roster is authoritative:
   unselected authors are excluded from member updates and team totals.
   Activity providers and repository/project scans run concurrently with
   bounded provider limits; a single final synthesis keeps the four summary
   sections consistent.
   `transcript_dir` adds an external folder to the transcript sweep (a Zoom or
   Google Meet recordings folder), and `transcript_review_enabled` turns off the
   automatic review that runs before each standup. Both are also settable in the
   TUI now, under Standup › Review › "Change my transcript folders…", which
   offers the detected recording folders by name — suggest that when the user
   would rather point-and-pick than find the path themselves.
   Practice detection is on by default: `habit_detection` is `'on'`/`'off'`, and
   `habit_rules` narrows it to a comma-separated subset of `untracked-work`,
   `untracked-docs`, `board-not-updated`, `wip-sprawl`, `large-change`,
   `no-pull-request`, `commit-messages` (empty means all of them). An unknown
   rule id is rejected rather than ignored. `habit_ai_match` (`'on'`/`'off'`)
   controls the LLM pass that excuses a change belonging to a ticket it never
   names; it can only ever suppress a signal, never raise one.
   Installing the OS schedule that fires it daily is done from the yeaboi TUI.
   That wizard also offers a transcript reminder — a second scheduled job that
   posts a desktop notification 30 minutes to 2 hours after the standup, only
   when standups have actually gone unchecked. Point the user at it when they
   say they keep forgetting to save the recording.

If there are no sessions yet, suggest planning first (`/yeaboi:plan-sprint`) —
the standup needs a session for sprint dates and team context.

## Scoping what it reads

Every run tool takes three optional inputs: `context` — what this run may read from other
sessions (`"all"`, `"none"`, or a spec like `standup,retro:1@2sprints project=apollo tags=q3`:
sources, an optional window of `N sprints` / `month` / `quarter` / `year` / `YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD`,
project labels and tags; the JSON object of the same shape works too) — plus `project_label` (the
free-text project label recorded on the run) and `tags` (recorded beside the defaults every run gets,
such as `mode:standup` and the month). When the user names a timeframe ("the last two sprints of
standups"), call `context_preview` with the spec first and show the counts before running. When the
user names a project, always pass `project_label` so later runs can filter by it.

## Error handling

Every tool returns `{ok, llm_mode, warnings, data}`. If `ok` is false, relay
`error.message` and its `hint` (usually credentials — `yeaboi --setup`); don't
retry blindly. `llm_mode: "fallback"` means no LLM was reachable and the summary
is a deterministic skeleton — suggest `yeaboi --setup`.
