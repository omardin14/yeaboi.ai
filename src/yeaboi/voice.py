"""Voice input — record from the microphone and transcribe locally (offline).

This module lets users *speak* their answers instead of typing them. It is used
by the TUI text-entry loops (project description, intake question answers, and
the artifact editor) which trigger recording on Ctrl+R.

# See README: "Voice Input" — voice is an optional, provider-agnostic helper.
# It does NOT go through the LangGraph agent or the get_llm() provider factory.

Design notes / architectural decisions:
- **Local, provider-agnostic transcription.** Speech-to-text runs on-device via
  `faster-whisper` (a CTranslate2 Whisper implementation). This works no matter
  which LLM_PROVIDER (Anthropic/Bedrock/OpenAI/Google) drives the planning
  agent, and needs **no API key** — Anthropic and Bedrock have no speech-to-text
  endpoint, so a cloud STT would have forced an OpenAI key on everyone.
- **Lazy imports.** Both heavy dependencies (`sounddevice` for mic capture and
  `faster_whisper` for transcription) are imported *inside* functions, mirroring
  the optional-provider pattern in `agent/llm.py`. Importing this module never
  fails; the deps are only needed when voice is actually used. Install with:
  ``uv sync --extra voice``. The sounddevice wheels bundle PortAudio on macOS
  and Windows (nothing else to install); on Linux the wheel is pure-Python and
  needs the system library too (e.g. ``sudo apt install libportaudio2``).
- **Cheap availability probe.** :func:`is_voice_available` uses
  ``importlib.util.find_spec`` so a per-render hint check never triggers the
  heavy ``faster_whisper`` / ``ctranslate2`` import; real mic/model failures are
  handled gracefully at record/transcribe time.
- **Model cache.** The Whisper model is loaded once per size and reused — the
  first transcription downloads the model (~75 MB "tiny" … ~460 MB "small");
  subsequent ones are fast.
- **WAV assembled with the stdlib.** Recorded int16 frames are written with the
  standard-library ``wave`` module and decoded back to a float32 array for the
  model, so we never depend on ffmpeg or PyAV's decode path.
