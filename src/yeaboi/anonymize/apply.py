"""Apply an anonymize replacement map to a mode's *native* data — in place.

The anonymize engine (``engine.run_anonymize``) returns an ``AnonymizedOutput`` whose
``replacements`` field is the ``(original -> placeholder)`` set it masked. The TUI used
to throw away every mode's card UI and show that engine output as a raw-Markdown review
screen; instead we now re-render each mode's *own* screen with only the sensitive words
swapped. This module is the seam: it takes that replacement map and applies it to the
two shapes a result screen renders from —

  * a frozen artifact (StandupReport / RetroReport / RoadmapAnalysis / TeamProfile) —
    ``mask_artifact`` walks ``asdict(artifact)``, masks every string leaf, and rebuilds
    the dataclass via the mode's existing ``_dict_to_*`` reconstructor; the native
    screen builder is fed the masked artifact and renders exactly as before.
  * a pre-rendered ``list[str]`` (performance / reporting ``detail_lines``, planning
    ``content_lines``) — ``mask_lines`` maps the masker over each line.

Everything is pure/deterministic and LLM-free (the LLM already ran in the engine), so it
lives here as headless, unit-tested logic rather than inside the TUI.
