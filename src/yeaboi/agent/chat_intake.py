"""Pre-intake chat exchange — greeting and project-size resolution.

# See docs: "Prompt Construction" — the flipped prompt (the classifier
# returns JSON; this module owns the decision)
# See docs: "Scrum Standards" — Small vs Large plans

The live chat opens BEFORE the first graph invocation: the agent greets, the
user describes the project, and the size (Small → "small_project", Large →
"smart") is settled conversationally instead of via the old intake cards.
Everything here is deliberately outside the graph:

- ``project_intake`` reads ``state["messages"][0]`` as the project
  description, so the greeting/size exchange must never enter ``messages`` —
  the chat driver keeps it in the ``_chat_preamble`` state field and makes
  the first graph invoke with the description as the one HumanMessage,
  byte-identical to what the old card flow produced. Planning results are
  therefore unaffected by the new front door.
- Size resolution is deterministic-first: an explicit reply ("1", "small",
  "large"...) is parsed locally; only a real description triggers one JSON
  classification call, and "unclear"/failure falls back to asking the
  numbered question — which always works, LLM or no LLM.
