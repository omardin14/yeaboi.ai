"""Streaming transport for the planning live chat — one turn, token by token.

# See docs: "Architecture" — The ReAct Loop (the agent node is the only
# node whose reply is free prose; every other node emits template-built text
# or structured JSON)
# See docs: "Agentic Blueprint Reference" — streaming

The chat TUI calls stream_chat_turn() on a worker thread and paints tokens as
they arrive. Two internal paths give every turn the same feel through one
callback:

- **Real streaming** (the ``agent`` ReAct node only): ``graph.stream()`` with
  ``stream_mode="messages"`` attaches a LangGraph callback handler that makes
  the ``BaseChatModel.invoke()`` call *inside* the node transparently upgrade
  to provider streaming and surface each ``AIMessageChunk`` here — the node
  code is unchanged. This is the design the "streaming is handled at the REPL
  layer by iterating graph.stream()" comment in nodes.py always anticipated.
  Config reaches the node through the ordinary call chain — ``stream_chat_turn``
  is a synchronous ``graph.stream()`` on a worker thread, so the async-only
  contextvars caveat in LangChain's docs does not apply and no plumbing is needed.
- **Typewriter** (everything else — intake questions, review summaries): the
  text is template-built by the node, not LLM prose, so there is nothing to
  stream. We run a plain ``graph.invoke()`` and then replay the finished text
  through the same on_token callback at a fixed characters-per-second pace.
  Replies longer than ``typewriter_max_chars`` skip the replay entirely and
  emit nothing: a wall of text (the intake summary, a pipeline review) would
  cramp the chat for many seconds only to be replaced by its artifact card,
  so the caller's loading state covers the invoke and the card lands at once.

Pipeline JSON nodes (analyzer/features/stories/tasks/sprints) never take the
real-streaming path: forcing provider streaming onto JSON-mode calls is
provider-fragile (e.g. Ollama ``format="json"``), and their output is parsed,
not displayed. They run under the typewriter path, where graph.invoke() is
byte-identical to today's behaviour — planning results are unaffected.

Thread contract: stream_chat_turn() runs on a worker thread. ``on_token`` is
called from that thread and must be cheap and thread-safe — appending to a
plain list is the intended use (list.append is atomic under the GIL; the
render loop joins the buffer each frame). It must NEVER touch Rich/Live
objects; the main thread owns rendering.
