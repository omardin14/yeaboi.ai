"""Cost and security posture of one finished agent run, from its transcript.

agentwatch already knows how to stream a Claude Code transcript into per-model
token usage (deduped by requestId), price it through ``pricing.py``, and flag
secrets / risky bash along the way. This module reuses that machinery for a
single known file instead of a full-tree sweep.

It deliberately lives here rather than as new public API on
``agentwatch/collector.py``: this thin adapter imports that family's internals
instead of widening its surface as a side effect of the ship mode.

Reading ``~/.claude/projects`` is already permitted (and read-only) under
``fs_policy``'s built-in rules; the transcript filename is the session id, so
``locate_transcript`` is a glob, not a database.
