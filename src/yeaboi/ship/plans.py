"""Where ship finds a plan to ship — across BOTH stores yeaboi persists plans to.

yeaboi keeps completed plans in two places, by entry path:

- the **interactive planning chat** saves the whole graph state to
  ``persistence.py`` (``~/.yeaboi/data/states/<project-id>.json`` indexed by
  ``projects.json``);
- the **MCP ``plan_*`` tools and the headless pipeline** save to the SQLite
  ``SessionStore`` (``sessions.py``).

Ship was written against the SQLite store only, so a plan built in the chat — the
primary planning UX — is invisible to it: the picker shows "no stories" over a
plan that plainly exists. This module is the one place that reconciles the two,
used by both the picker (``_load_plan``) and the engine (``_load_target``) so
they can never disagree about where a plan lives.

Identifiers do not collide between the stores (project ids are UUIDs, session
ids are ``new-<hex>-<date>``), so :func:`load_plan_state` can try one then the
other and return the first that resolves.

"Has a plan" means any of epics, stories or tasks — ship targets all three, and
gating on stories alone made a plan that was decomposed only as far as its epics
invisible to both the picker and the engine.
