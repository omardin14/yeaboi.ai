"""Canonical wording for what leaves this machine, and what never does.

yeaboi's honest privacy posture: everything the app makes stays on this
machine, telemetry is off unless the user turns it on, and nothing reaches us
unless the user sends feedback. The prompts a mode writes go to the AI provider
the user configured — and only there; picking Ollama keeps even those local.

Every surface renders from this module — the TUI privacy page, the setup
wizard's welcome panel, the desktop Privacy page (over ``GET
/api/meta/privacy``), the desktop onboarding welcome step — because a privacy
claim that differs between surfaces is worse than no claim (the ``beta.py``
rule). The wire handler serializes these values verbatim; it never defines.

This module **discloses** behavior, it never changes it: every ``off_switch``
below is a switch that already exists, named exactly. ``tests/unit/
test_privacy.py`` pins each named env var to the module that reads it.

Deliberately **import-free**, like ``beta.py``: startup-latency-sensitive
surfaces pull from it, and the test suite AST-scans it so a creeping import
cannot be silent.
