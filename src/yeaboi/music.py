"""Background music via ffplay — optional, auto-detected headless stream player.

This module lets users play focus music while planning. It shells out to
**ffplay** (ffmpeg's bundled player), and is modelled directly on
:mod:`yeaboi.voice`: an optional, provider-agnostic helper that talks to an
external binary.

# See README: "Music (ffplay)" — like voice input, background music does NOT go
# through the LangGraph agent or the get_llm() provider factory. It is a pure
# terminal-UX helper.

Design notes / architectural decisions:
- **Why ffplay, not a TUI player.** Background music has to play *headlessly*
  alongside our own full-screen TUI. Interactive terminal players (e.g. cliamp,
  which this module originally targeted) refuse to start without a controlling TTY
  and would fight us for the terminal. ``ffplay -nodisp`` has no UI of its own and
  reads a stream URL directly, so it plays in the background and never touches the
  terminal. ffmpeg is ubiquitous and frequently already installed.
- **Optional and auto-detected.** ffplay is a binary, not a Python package, so we
  never import or bundle it. :func:`is_music_available` just checks
  ``shutil.which("ffplay")`` — cheap enough to call on every screen render,
  mirroring :func:`yeaboi.voice.is_voice_available`. If the binary is absent
  every entry point below is a graceful no-op.
- **One long-lived process per stream.** We keep a handle to a single ffplay
  subprocess playing the current channel. ffplay exposes no IPC, so transport is
  done on the process itself: pause/resume suspend and continue it with
  ``SIGSTOP`` / ``SIGCONT`` (a genuine pause of audio output), and switching
  channel or stopping terminates and respawns it.
- **Channels = radio streams.** ffplay plays a stream URL directly, so a
  "channel" is just an entry in :data:`CHANNELS`. Switching channel respawns the
  player on the next stream URL.
- **Never raises into the TUI.** Every subprocess/signal call is wrapped; a
  missing or broken ffplay logs a warning and leaves music off. Music must never
  break planning.
