"""Collaboration server for the Poker board — stdlib ``http.server`` only.

Planning poker needs the whole team, but the app runs locally in a terminal. So
the host starts a session and this module spins up a tiny HTTP server; teammates
open the board in any browser (no install) and vote live. Standard-library
``http.server`` — NOT FastAPI/Flask — to match the codebase's stdlib-only
networking ethos (same as retro/server.py, which this mirrors).

Design (identical to the retro blueprint):
  * ``ThreadingHTTPServer`` on a background daemon thread; each request gets its
    own thread. The shared :class:`~yeaboi.poker.board.PokerBoard` is the single
    source of truth and is itself lock-guarded.
  * Access is gated by a per-session random token (``secrets.token_urlsafe``)
    checked with ``access.secret_equal`` (constant-time, and total over
    non-ASCII input). ``GET /`` serves
    the harmless page; every ``/api/*`` call requires the token. Admin routes
    additionally require the admin secret that only rides in the host's link.
  * The server binds **loopback only**; teammates reach it exclusively through
    the Cloudflare quick tunnel the TUI starts with the board, which fronts it
    with HTTPS. See :mod:`yeaboi.retro.server` for why the LAN address went.

Poker-specific threading rule: **tracker writes run synchronously in the
per-request handler thread** (finalize/edit — the admin must know the write
succeeded before the session advances; other participants' polls are unaffected
because every request has its own thread), while the **AI perspective runs on a
worker thread** (an LLM call can take 10-30 s; the result lands on the board
and every client picks it up on its next poll). Duel ("open the floor")
transcription follows the same pattern: a ``poker-duel-stt`` worker thread
transcribes the captured audio (local Whisper can take a while, especially the
first model download) and lands the transcript via ``set_duel_transcript``.
The board lock is never held across any of this I/O. The live audio hardware
(:class:`_DuelCapture`) is owned by the SERVER, never the board — the board is
pure snapshot-able state; a recorder holds an open mic stream.
