"""The live, in-memory poker board — the single source of truth during a session.

Planning poker is collaborative: while the host's TUI is open, teammates POST
votes from their browsers (poker/server.py) on background HTTP threads, and the
TUI render loop reads the board every frame on the main thread. Two-thread
access means all state MUST be guarded — ``PokerBoard`` owns one
``threading.Lock`` (the same concurrency contract as retro/board.py):

  * State is only ever mutated while holding ``_lock``.
  * Readers assemble a *copy* inside the lock, then work on the copy outside —
    the lock is never held across a Rich render, a JSON dump, or (crucially)
    a tracker/LLM network call.
  * ``_revision`` is bumped on every mutation, giving both the browser poller
    and the TUI an O(1) "did anything change?" check.

Per-ticket phase machine::

    "voting" ──reveal()──▶ "revealed" ──finalize_current()──▶ next ticket ("voting")
        ▲                      │  ▲
        │                      │  └──close_duel()── "duel" ◀──open_duel()──┘
        └──── restart_vote() ──┘

The "duel" phase is the open floor: the lowest and highest voters argue their
estimates in timed turns while the debate is recorded. The duel *state*
(``_duel``) outlives the phase — after close_duel() the board is back in
"revealed" while transcription runs (status "transcribing" → "done"/"failed"),
so finalize/re-vote/AI stay available. A finalize while the duel is still
transcribing drops the transcript (the browser disables Finalize until
transcription lands; a raw-HTTP admin bypassing that loses only their own
transcript).

Vote secrecy is enforced HERE, server-side: before the reveal,
``state_snapshot`` only ever exposes *who* has voted (plus the viewer's own
value) — other participants' values never go on the wire, so no client can
peek. Raw pids never leave the board either (retro's ``mine`` pattern).

The frozen, serializable artifacts (``PokerVote``, ``PokerTicketResult``,
``PokerReport``) live in agent/state.py; this module owns only the mutable live
object and the board → report snapshot.
