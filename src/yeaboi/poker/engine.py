"""Poker engine — the one LLM call that gives an AI perspective on a vote spread.

Like the retro engine, this is a standalone helper (NOT a LangGraph node): it
calls the LLM directly via ``invoke_json`` and follows the same
**parse → fallback → format** convention the graph nodes use (agent/nodes.py).
After the admin reveals the votes on a ticket, they can ask for an AI take —
the model sees the ticket, the revealed spread, and the team's recorded history
from the other yeaboi modes (poker/context.py: calibration data, delivered
tickets, standup blockers, retro themes, planned-story sizing), comments on the
disagreement, and suggests a deck estimate — citing the data points it used.

An LLM auth/billing error is NOT re-raised — it is folded into the returned
dict and the deterministic fallback (median + spread note) is used, so a live
poker session never crashes over a missing key (same policy as retro/engine.py).

# See docs: "The ReAct Loop" — using the LLM outside the main graph
# See docs: "Prompt Construction" — the poker perspective prompt
