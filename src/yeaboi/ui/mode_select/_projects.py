"""The Projects page loops: the list, one project, a new project's draft.

Reads are cheap and the pages are short, so each re-reads the store on every
action rather than caching. The list opens a project's page; the page's
Start makes it the active project (``projects/active.py``, the process-local
choice every mode launch site reads so its runs are scoped) and returns its
id, which the door (``pick=True``) and the menu's ``P`` keycap both read.
Plan does the same and names the card to run, so the menu opens on it.
