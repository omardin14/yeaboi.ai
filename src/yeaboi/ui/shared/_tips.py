"""Rotating discoverability tips for the welcome screen.

Single source of truth for the tip list and the (pure) rotation math. Kept out of
the screen builders so it can be unit-tested without a Rich Console and reused if
other screens want to surface a tip.

# See docs: "Architecture" — pure helpers with no side effects; the screen
# builder decides how to render them.

Design notes:
- **Feature-keyed tips.** Every tip that describes a real product capability is a
  :class:`FeatureTip` keyed by its ``CAPABILITIES`` key (see
  ``tests/unit/test_surface_parity.py``). One parity test per surface fails
  ``make test`` if a capability reaches a surface without a tip there — so both
  lists stay current as features land.
- **Driven by the existing render tick.** The mode-select loop already re-renders
  at 60 FPS and threads a continuous ``shimmer_tick`` (seconds since the loop
  started) into the screen builder. :func:`current_tip` turns that float into a
  tip index with plain modulo arithmetic — no timer or background thread. The loop
  may also pass a manual ``override`` index (‹/› browsing) via :func:`resolve_index`.
- **Availability-aware ambient tips.** The first tip adapts to whether the voice
  extra is installed, and the terminal's last to whether ffplay is present,
  mirroring ``_voice_hint()`` in the input screens.
- **Cached list.** Voice/music availability can't change during a process, so the
  tip list is memoised — this keeps the per-frame render from re-running the
  ``find_spec`` availability probe 60×/second.

    """One discoverability tip.

    ``key`` is the parity axis: for feature tips it matches a ``CAPABILITIES`` key
    in ``tests/unit/test_surface_parity.py``; ambient tips (voice/music/meta) use
    synthetic keys and are exempt from parity. ``mode_key`` is the ``_MODE_CARDS``
    key to jump to when the user presses the open key, or ``None`` when the feature
    isn't reachable as a home-screen mode. ``is_new`` renders a small NEW badge.
    ``is_beta`` renders a BETA badge — the capability ships and works, but its
    output isn't verified yet. The two are different claims and must not be
    conflated; where both are set, BETA wins (see the render sites).

    ``surfaces`` are the surfaces the tip is true on. Untagged means all of them,
    which is the common case: a tip that describes what a feature does holds
    everywhere, and only a tip that names a gesture — a keycap, a CLI flag, a
    control that exists in one window and not the other — needs splitting. Two
    tips may share a ``key`` and differ only by surface (see ``niko``).

    ``worlds`` are the landing worlds the tip is true in. Untagged means all of
    them; a tip that names a room full of teammates (a live retro board, planning
    poker, a 1:1) is tagged Team-only so the Solo welcome never rotates it.
