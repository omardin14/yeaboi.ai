"""Rotating discoverability tips for the welcome screen.

Single source of truth for the tip list and the (pure) rotation math. Kept out of
the screen builders so it can be unit-tested without a Rich Console and reused if
other screens want to surface a tip.

# See README: "Architecture" — pure helpers with no side effects; the screen
# builder decides how to render them.

Design notes:
- **Feature-keyed tips.** Every tip that describes a real product capability is a
  :class:`FeatureTip` keyed by its ``CAPABILITIES`` key (see
  ``tests/unit/test_surface_parity.py``). A parity test fails ``make test`` if a
  capability ships without a tip — so the tips stay current as features land.
- **Driven by the existing render tick.** The mode-select loop already re-renders
  at 60 FPS and threads a continuous ``shimmer_tick`` (seconds since the loop
  started) into the screen builder. :func:`current_tip` turns that float into a
  tip index with plain modulo arithmetic — no timer or background thread. The loop
  may also pass a manual ``override`` index (‹/› browsing) via :func:`resolve_index`.
- **Availability-aware ambient tips.** The first tip adapts to whether the voice
  extra is installed and the last to whether ffplay is present, mirroring
  ``_voice_hint()`` in the input screens.
- **Cached list.** Voice/music availability can't change during a process, so the
  tip list is memoised — this keeps the per-frame render from re-running the
  ``find_spec`` availability probe 60×/second.
