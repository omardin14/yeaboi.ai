"""Shared scroll-offset helpers for the full-screen TUI.

# See README: "Architecture" — the TUI is a hand-rolled scroller on rich.Live.
# Each screen renders content to text lines and slices lines[offset:offset+h].

Historically every scroll loop tracked its own offset and let the *screen
builder* clamp for display only (``max(0, min(offset, max_scroll))``). The
clamped value was thrown away, so the loop's counter kept growing past the end
— then scrolling back up wasted N dead keypresses with no visible movement (the
"impossible to scroll sometimes" bug).

The fix: the builder is the single source of truth for how far a screen can
scroll (line-based screens use ``max_scroll(total, viewport)``; variable-height
screens compute their own ``max_scroll``). It hands that back to the loop via
``publish_geometry`` into a shared ``scroll_meta`` dict, and the loop advances
its offset with ``apply_scroll`` using those exact bounds — so the loop counter
and the on-screen position can never diverge.
