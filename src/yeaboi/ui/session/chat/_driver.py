"""The chat driver — one state-driven loop replacing the phased planning flow.

# See docs: "Architecture" — TUI system; "Session Management" — resume
# See docs: "Guardrails" — input guardrails + human-in-the-loop

Each loop iteration inspects graph_state and decides what the conversation
needs next (the same predicates the old phases used), so resume, the PTO
sub-loop, and mid-chat size switches fall out of state inspection rather
than control flow:

  greeting/size (TUI-side, kept in _chat_preamble — NEVER in messages,
  because project_intake reads messages[0] as the description)
  → intake Q&A (one question per graph invoke, choices drawn inline)
  → intake review (summary card + accept/edit replies)
  → pipeline stages (auto-advanced; artifact cards + accept/edit replies;
    capacity overflow stays a popup — its semantics must not drift)
  → free refinement chat (streamed via the agent ReAct node).

Threading: every graph call runs on a worker thread through
stream_chat_turn(); the main thread paints 30fps frames, joining the token
buffer each frame. on_token appends to a plain list (GIL-atomic) and never
touches Rich/Live.
