"""One reader-authored correction, and how a log of them becomes an artifact.

Two halves, deliberately separated:

* :func:`validate` runs **once**, when an edit arrives from a browser. It is the
  only place untrusted text is inspected — length caps, control characters,
  prompt-injection patterns, allowlist membership. What comes out is safe to
  store.
* :func:`apply_edits` runs **every time** the artifact is materialised, over
  edits that were validated when they arrived. It re-derives rather than
  mutating, so a document is always ``base + the log``, and the log is the
  version history rather than a description of one.

Materialisation is ``asdict`` → ordered patch → the registry's reconstructor.
That is the same three steps :func:`yeaboi.anonymize.apply.mask_artifact` takes,
which is not a coincidence — masking and editing are both "transform a frozen
artifact, get a frozen artifact back", and the repo already had exactly one way
to do it.

Compare-and-swap, and what it is actually for
---------------------------------------------

Every ``set`` and ``remove`` carries ``base``: the value the editor could see
when they started typing. It answers two different questions with one field.

*Live*, it catches a concurrent editor — two people fixing the same sentence,
the second one overwriting a correction they never saw.

*On replay*, it catches something more dangerous. The log outlives the artifact
it was written against: a standup can be re-run, an artifact regenerated, and
the same paths then point at different prose. Without the check, an edit that
said "fix this typo" would silently overwrite a sentence nobody ever read. With
it, the edit is marked stale and reported as such — the correction is not lost,
it is *shown as unapplied*, which is the honest outcome.

Reverting
---------

A revert targets a non-revert edit, and a revert cannot itself be reverted. That
is a real limitation and it buys a real thing: deadness is one set comprehension
over the log rather than a fixed-point over a graph that a malicious client
could make cyclic. Undoing a revert is what the UI already offers for everything
else — type the value back, which is a new edit, attributed to whoever did it.
