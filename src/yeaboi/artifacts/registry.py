"""What each editable artifact is, and which parts of it a reader may correct.

One row per artifact kind. A row says four things:

* how to rebuild the frozen dataclass from an ``asdict`` tree (the *reconstructor*),
* which lists are addressed by which natural key (``list_keys``),
* which fields are editable at all, and how long each may be (``fields``),
* and what to call the thing in a UI (``label``, ``mode``).

Why a registry rather than methods on the artifacts
---------------------------------------------------

The artifacts live in :mod:`yeaboi.agent.state` and are deliberately dumb: frozen
dataclasses with defaulted fields and no behaviour, so that a stored report from
six months ago still deserialises. Hanging an edit policy off them would put
browser-facing security decisions in the one module every other module imports.
Keeping it here also means the *deny* decisions are all readable in one screen,
which is the property that matters — see :func:`editable_field`.

This module is also the single home for the ``dict -> dataclass`` rebuilders.
:mod:`yeaboi.anonymize.apply` used to keep its own copy of that mapping, which
had drifted: it had no entry for any performance artifact, so masking a 1:1 prep
silently returned it unmasked. There is now one registry and both callers read it.
