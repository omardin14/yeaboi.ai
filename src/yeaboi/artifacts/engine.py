"""Headless access to a stored artifact's corrections.

Three public entry points, and only three — the surface-parity check treats
every public top-level function in an ``engine.py`` as a capability that must be
registered, which is the right pressure: a helper that leaks out here is a
surface nobody decided to ship.

No LLM anywhere in this file. Correcting a report is the one operation in the
product where a model has no business being involved: the whole point is that a
person knows something the model got wrong.
