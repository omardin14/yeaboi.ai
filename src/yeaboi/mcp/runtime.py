"""Shared runtime for MCP tool handlers — result envelope + engine dispatch.

# See README: "MCP Server" — result envelope and LLM modes

Every yeaboi MCP tool returns the same JSON envelope so host agents can
handle results uniformly:

    {"ok": true,  "llm_mode": "sampling|provider|fallback|n/a",
     "warnings": [...], "data": {...}}
    {"ok": false, "error": {"type": ..., "message": ...}, "hint": "..."}

``llm_mode`` tells the host how the content was produced: ``sampling`` =
the host's own model (MCP sampling), ``provider`` = the user's configured
LLM (~/.yeaboi/.env), ``fallback`` = no LLM was available so the engine's
deterministic fallback artifact was returned, ``n/a`` = no LLM involved.

``run_engine()`` is the single dispatch point for every engine call. It runs
the (synchronous) engine on a worker thread so the server's event loop stays
responsive, injects the sampling-backed model via ``llm_override()`` when the
client supports sampling, and converts any exception into a structured error
payload — a tool call must never crash the server.
