        velocity, story-point calibration, writing style, DoD signals, plus coaching insights
        and headline stats. The profile is saved and feeds future planning. Quick depth
        performs tracker paging but no LLM calls; Deep may take minutes on a cold cache.
        source: 'jira', 'azdevops', or 'both' (blank auto-detects a single tracker). With 'both'
        the analysis runs once per configured tracker and returns a combined result
        {source:'both', results:{jira:..., azdevops:...}, comparison:[[label,jira,azdevops],...]} —
        the two profiles are kept clearly separate, never blended (project_key is ignored and
        auto-resolved per source). generate_samples additionally drafts
        sample tickets in the team's style (more LLM calls). include_ai_usage also scans the
        team's commits/PRs for AI-tool markers (Co-Authored-By: Claude, Copilot, Cursor, …) and
        reports a detectable AI-adoption footprint — a LOWER BOUND (inline IDE assist leaves no
        trace); set False to skip those GitHub/AzDO network calls. include_doc_quality also reads
        every recently changed page in the configured Notion/Confluence estate and reports
        documentation clarity, ownership, structure, and actionability; set False to skip those calls.
        analysis_depth is "deep" (default, exhaustive AI enrichment) or "quick"
        (deterministic metrics only). analysis_window_days defaults to 120.
        components selects which parts run, each over its OWN sub-sources:
        {"delivery": ["jira","azdevops"], "code": ["github","azdo"], "docs": ["confluence","notion"],
        "ops": [connected ops connector keys]}.
        analysis_features independently selects result areas from delivery, ai_footprint,
        code_health, documentation, and operational; None runs every area supported by components.
        operational reports the incident/alert rate over the window from the connected monitoring
        tools — team-wide counts only, never per person, and absent unless one is connected.
        Delivery runs one velocity profile PER selected tracker; code and docs are each ONE global
        scan over their selected hosts. An absent/empty component is skipped; None falls back to the
        include_* booleans. Result: {delivery:{tracker:{profile,...}}, code:{signal,examples}|null,
        docs:{signal,examples}|null, ops:{signal,examples}|null, comparison, warnings}.
        members re-scopes each delivery tracker's velocity/contributors and is mandatory scope
        for code analysis, e.g. {"jira": ["Alice","Bob"]}. Code results contain only matched
        selected-user commits, authored PRs, activity, and changed files; a blank or unmatched
        scope never falls back to whole-team code. Discover names with team_roster.
        A solo-world run is simply members=None — whole-history, no roster narrowing.
        Analysis reads no other session, so `context` narrows nothing here; it is recorded on
        the profile beside `project_label` and `tags` so later exports and filters know it."""
