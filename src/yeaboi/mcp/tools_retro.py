"""MCP tools: Retro history (read-only).

The live retro itself stays in the TUI — it is a real-time LAN browser board
(collaborative card entry, timers, presence), not something a single tool
call can host. What agents can usefully read is the *outcome*: past boards
with their cards, reactions, and action items.
