"""yeaboi MCP server — stdio entry point (`yeaboi-mcp`).

# See README: "MCP Server"

Runs a Model Context Protocol server over stdio so AI coding agents
(Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, VS Code, …) can call yeaboi's planning
pipeline, standups, delivery reports, and performance workflows as tools.

Configure it in any MCP client as:

    command: uvx
    args: ["--from", "yeaboi[mcp]", "yeaboi-mcp"]

Critical stdio rule: stdout carries the JSON-RPC stream, so nothing in this
process may print() to stdout — human-facing output goes to stderr, and all
diagnostics go to ~/.yeaboi/logs/mcp/mcp.log.
