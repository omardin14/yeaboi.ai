"""Canonical wording for features that ship in beta.

A feature is "beta" here when it works end to end but its *output* has not been
validated against real-world data yet. That is a different claim from "coming
soon" (not usable) and from "new" (usable and verified, just recent), and it
deserves its own vocabulary so every surface says the same thing.

This module is deliberately **import-free**. Every surface pulls from it —
``cli.py``, ``mcp/tools_performance.py``, the TUI screens, the tip registry —
and two of those are startup-latency sensitive:

* The constants cannot live in ``performance/``. ``mcp/tools_performance.py``
  reaches the engines through function-level imports precisely so the MCP
  server boots without them; a module-scope ``from yeaboi.performance.beta
  import …`` would execute ``performance/__init__.py``, which eagerly imports
  ``context``/``roster``/``store`` and through them ``langchain_core`` — about
  0.2s onto every server start. (Note ``performance/__init__.py``'s own
  docstring still claims importing the package "never drags in langchain";
  that is stale — ``import yeaboi.performance`` does pull ``langchain_core``
  today. Its lazy ``__getattr__`` defers only the three engine entry points.)
* ``ui/shared/`` is out too — ``mcp/`` importing a UI module inverts the layering.

``tests/unit/test_beta.py`` AST-scans this file and fails if an import ever
appears, because the cost would be silent.

HTML, Markdown and the plugin ``SKILL.md`` cannot import Python, so their copies
are hand-written; ``tests/unit/test_beta_surfaces.py`` pins them to these values.

# ── The one-time entry gate ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A mode card's BETA chip says *that* a mode is unverified; this is the copy
# that says how, shown once the first time the mode is opened. It lives here,
# beside the notices, because two surfaces now render it — the TUI's full-screen
# gate and the desktop's modal — and a caveat that differs between them is
# worse than no caveat.
#
# Copy rule: name what can actually go wrong and what stays local. A generic
# "this feature is experimental" tells the user nothing they can act on, and
# reads as liability cover rather than information.
#
# Plain dicts and tuples, because this module must stay import-free (see above);
# each surface wraps them in whatever shape it renders.
