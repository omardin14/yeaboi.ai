"""Gather the team's *delivered* (completed) work over a reporting period.

Deterministic (no LLM): reuses the same team-wide recent-activity helpers the Daily
Standup collector uses (``jira_recent_activity`` / ``azdevops_recent_activity``) plus
the standup's ``sprint_context.gather`` for the active-sprint name and length, then
keeps only the tickets whose status means *done*. These DeliveredItem rows are the
concrete evidence the business-report prompt reasons over.

Tool helpers are imported lazily (optional SDKs), same convention as
performance/activity.py. Degrades to an empty list on missing config — the engine
turns that into a warning, never a crash.
