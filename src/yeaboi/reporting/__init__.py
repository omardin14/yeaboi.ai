"""Reporting mode — a business-friendly summary of delivered work.

A team lead picks a period (last sprint, or the last ~month / ~2 sprints) and the
mode gathers the tickets the team actually completed from Jira / Azure DevOps, then
runs a single LLM "design" pass to write an executive narrative, group the work into
outcome themes, and pick section emojis. The result is exported as Markdown, a
self-contained HTML report, and a self-contained HTML *slide deck* for presenting to
the business.

Public API is re-exported here; submodules lazy-import their optional/heavy deps
(LLM, tracker SDKs) inside functions, so importing this package is always cheap and
safe — mirrors the standup / retro / performance packages.
