"""Which modes may run on a cadence, and how to call each one.

This is the admission test for the whole feature, and it is deliberately a
table rather than a paragraph: a mode absent from ``CATALOG`` cannot be
scheduled from the TUI, the CLI or MCP, because every surface resolves through
:func:`lookup`. ``UNSCHEDULABLE`` records the ones left out *with their reason*,
so "why can't I schedule a retro" has an answer in the same file.

Engines and renderers are named as ``(module, attribute)`` strings and imported
lazily. Importing seven engine modules to draw a list of ceremony names would
pull LangChain into the TUI's start-up path, and the surface-parity check
AST-scans these modules rather than importing them.

Every declared parameter is a *string* on the wire (see ``state.Ceremony``);
:func:`engine_kwargs` coerces them to what the engine actually takes.
