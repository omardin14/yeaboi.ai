"""Firing one ceremony: guard it, run it, deliver it, record it.

One code path serves both callers. The OS job runs
``yeaboi ceremonies run <name> --scheduled``; a human pressing "Run now" in the
TUI runs the same function without the flag. What ``scheduled`` changes is only
the guards, because they are answers to questions an unattended run raises and
a deliberate one does not:

- **Staleness.** launchd coalesces missed calendar intervals and fires once at
  wake, so a 09:00 standup can arrive at 14:00 when the laptop lid opens; cron
  does not fire at all. A five-hour-old standup posted to the team channel is
  worse than no standup, so a late fire is skipped and recorded as skipped.
- **The monthly cap.** Unattended spend is the thing nobody is watching. A human
  who explicitly asks for a run gets it.
- **Pause.** A paused ceremony has no job, so a fire means the store and the
  operating system have drifted; the store wins and the drift is recorded.

Whatever happens, exactly one ledger row is written — including for the runs the
guards decline. A scheduled run that fails at 06:00 with nobody watching is how
this feature dies quietly, and a row saying *why* is the difference between
"nothing happened" and "something stopped it".

# See docs: "Architecture" — the engines; a ceremony is a scheduled call into one
