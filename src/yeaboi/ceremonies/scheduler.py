"""OS-native scheduling — the clock behind every recurring run.

The whole point of this module is that a ceremony fires *even when yeaboi is
closed*. Rather than keep a daemon alive, we register a job with the operating
system's own scheduler — launchd on macOS, crontab on Linux.

It grew out of the standup, which was for a long time the only thing with a
cadence, and it keeps that job's exact identifiers: ``JOB_STANDUP`` still maps
to the empty suffix, because ``com.yeaboi.standup.<session>`` is what is already
installed on real machines. ``standup/scheduler.py`` is now a shim over here.

Three job families, and every install/remove/status path takes the kind:

- ``JOB_STANDUP`` — interactive. A wrapper opens a Terminal window so the run
  can prompt for the user's own update.
- ``JOB_TRANSCRIPT_REMINDER`` — passive. One desktop notification, no window.
- ``ceremony_kind(name)`` — headless. Runs one declared ceremony to its channels
  and exits, and **never opens a window**: a ceremony is something you read in
  Slack at 09:00, not a terminal that appears while you are in a meeting.

Everything is stdlib + subprocess (no APScheduler dependency). Platform is
dispatched on ``sys.platform``. Windows is unsupported (returns a clear message)
— on-demand runs from the TUI still work everywhere.
