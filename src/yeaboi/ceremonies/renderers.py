"""One artifact → ``Dispatch`` renderer per catalogued mode.

Delivery used to be typed on ``StandupReport``, which is the whole reason
nothing but the standup could be delivered. These are the adapters that made
the channels mode-neutral: each takes its mode's artifact and produces the
title, the one-line summary a desktop notification can hold, and the plaintext
body Slack, email and the terminal all send.

Two rules the whole file follows:

- **The standup's body is the existing renderer, untouched.** Its bytes already
  go to real Slack channels and inboxes; a refactor that reformats them is a
  behaviour change wearing a refactor's clothes.
- **A body is a readout, not the report.** These land in a chat message, so
  they lead with the number somebody scrolls for and stop; the full artifact is
  a mode away, and the ledger records where the run is.
