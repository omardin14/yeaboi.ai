"""The chips Niko offers before you've typed anything.

Keyed by **capability**, not by route, and the route→capability mapping is read
from the committed desktop manifest. That is what stops the chips going stale:
rename a route and the mapping follows it; drop a capability and
``TestNikoSuggestions`` fails rather than the panel quietly offering a screen
that no longer exists.

Resolution order matches the surface's own specificity — exact route, then the
capability that owns it, then the section (``/team`` vs ``/agents``), then a
default set. A screen with nothing to say falls back rather than showing
nothing: an empty chip list reads as a broken panel.

``icon`` values are the strings the renderer's ICON_MAP already understands;
an unmapped one degrades to a compass rather than breaking the row.
