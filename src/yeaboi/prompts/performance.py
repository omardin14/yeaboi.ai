"""Prompt construction for Performance mode — 1:1 prep, 1:1 completion, review.

Three factories, one per workflow, each a single LLM call that returns a strict
JSON object the engine parses (parse → fallback convention). All use the ARC
framework (Ask · Requirements · Context) like every other prompt in this package.

A team lead is the audience for every output here: the tone is candid, specific,
and actionable — never vague praise. Transcripts and tickets are framed as
UNTRUSTED DATA so a stray "ignore your instructions" line in a pasted transcript
can't hijack the summary.

# See README: "Prompt Construction" — ARC framework, chain-of-thought, JSON output
