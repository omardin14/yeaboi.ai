"""Prompt construction for the Daily Standup summary.

One LLM call turns raw activity + sprint context into (a) a concise per-member
update for EVERY team member, derived from their tracked activity, and (b) a
team-level narrative. A member's typed self-report is passed as supporting
context for their entry — it enriches the analysis (extra intent, blockers)
but the summary must stay grounded in the listed activity, so the user still
learns what their activity shows even when they typed an update themselves.

Uses the ARC framework (Ask · Requirements · Context) like every other prompt in
this package.

# See README: "Prompt Construction" — ARC framework, chain-of-thought, JSON output

        "'comment' (engaged in a discussion), 'page'/'page-created' (wrote documentation), "

        "detected' for them. Only when all three are empty use 'No activity detected.' as the summary.\n"
        "- If their activity or self-report suggests a blocker (e.g. a PR stuck in review, a ticket "
        "flipped back to 'Blocked'), note it in 'blockers'; otherwise use an empty string.\n"
