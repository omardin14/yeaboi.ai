# The analyzer prompt takes the confirmed 30 Q&A pairs and asks the LLM to
# extract a structured ProjectAnalysis JSON object. This is a single LLM call
# with a JSON-schema prompt — same pattern as _extract_answers_from_description
# in nodes.py.
#
# Separated from node logic following the project convention: prompts/ holds
# templates, agent/ holds node functions. The system prompt docstring says
# "node-specific detail will be injected by the relevant nodes."
"""

# TOTAL_QUESTIONS is hardcoded (not imported from agent.state or intake) to avoid
# circular import: analyzer → intake → agent.state → agent/__init__ → agent.graph
# → agent.nodes → analyzer. The value matches TOTAL_QUESTIONS in agent/state.py.
TOTAL_QUESTIONS = 30

    # See README: "Prompt Construction" — ARC framework
    #
    # The prompt uses the ARC pattern:
    # - Actor: "You are a project analyst"
    # - Rules: JSON schema with extraction rules per field
    # - Context: The 26 Q&A pairs + team metrics
    #
    # Why a function (not a string constant)?
    # The answers_block, team_size, and velocity are dynamic — they come from
    # the confirmed questionnaire state. A function cleanly injects these into
    # the template without string-replace hacks.
    #
    # review_feedback / review_mode / previous_output follow the same pattern
    # as get_epic_generator_prompt — they are appended via _build_review_section
    # so the LLM can apply user corrections on re-runs.

    Args:
        answers_block: Formatted string of all 26 Q&A pairs with markers
            for defaulted/skipped answers.
        team_size: Number of engineers (from Q6 / state).
        velocity_per_sprint: Story points per sprint (from Q9 / state).
        repo_context: Raw string from tool scan (file tree + README). When
            provided, a "Repository Scan" section is injected so the LLM
            can ground tech_stack and project_type in real codebase data.
        confluence_context: Search results from Confluence (page titles +
            excerpts). When provided, a "Confluence Documentation" section is
            injected so the LLM can ground constraints and integrations in
            existing architecture docs, ADRs, and runbooks.
        notion_context: Search results / page content from Notion. When provided,
            a "Notion Documentation" section is injected — same purpose as
            confluence_context, for teams whose docs live in Notion.
        user_context: Content of SCRUM.md and/or scrum-docs/ files from the
            user's project root. When provided, a "User Context" section is
            injected so the LLM can incorporate PRDs, design docs, and notes.
        review_feedback: User feedback from a previous review (edit).
        review_mode: "edit" — controls how feedback is framed.
        previous_output: Serialized previous analysis for edit mode reference.

    Returns:
        The complete prompt string ready to send to the LLM.
