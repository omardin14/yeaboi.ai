"""Prompt construction for the Roadmap intake card — quarterly roadmap → projects.

One factory, one LLM call that reads the ingested roadmap document and returns a
strict JSON object the engine parses (parse → fallback convention). Like every
other prompt in this package it uses the ARC framework (Ask · Requirements ·
Context).

The roadmap document is external text the user pointed us at (a Confluence or
Notion page, a Word/PowerPoint file...) — it is framed as UNTRUSTED DATA so a
stray "ignore your instructions" line inside it can't hijack the analysis.

# See README: "Prompt Construction" — ARC framework, flipped prompt, JSON output
