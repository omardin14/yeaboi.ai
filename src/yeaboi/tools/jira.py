"""Jira Cloud tools — 1 read-only + 3 write (with user-confirmation guard in docstrings).

# See README: "Tools" — tool types, @tool decorator, risk levels
#
# Why jira (PyJira) instead of raw requests?
# PyJira wraps the REST API with typed objects and raises structured JIRAError
# exceptions (with status_code and text) on failures. This makes error handling
# predictable across all four tools — same pattern used by PyGithub and azure-devops.
#
# Auth: Jira Cloud uses HTTP Basic Auth with the user's email and an API token
# (not their password). Tokens are generated at id.atlassian.com → Security.
#
# Write tools carry a "only call after user confirms" note in their docstrings.
# The agent's ReAct loop reads these docstrings via bind_tools, so the agent
# knows to ask the user for confirmation before invoking any write operation.
# See README: "Guardrails" — human-in-the-loop pattern
