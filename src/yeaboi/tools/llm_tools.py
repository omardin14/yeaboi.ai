"""LLM-powered tools for the Scrum Agent ReAct loop.

# See README: "Tools" — tool types, @tool decorator, risk levels
# See README: "The ReAct Loop" — Thought → Action → Observation pattern
#
# These tools make a focused, single-purpose LLM call inside a @tool function.
# The agent invokes them during the ReAct loop when it needs complexity
# estimates or acceptance criteria — the tool result becomes the Observation
# that feeds the next Thought step.
#
# Why a separate LLM call inside a tool?
# The main agent loop reasons at a high level (planning, routing, summarising).
# These tools delegate narrow, structured sub-tasks to a fresh LLM call with a
# purpose-built prompt — cleaner separation of concerns than cramming everything
# into the system prompt.
#
# Risk level: low — read-only LLM inference, no filesystem or network side-effects.
