"""Notion tools — 3 read-only + 2 write (with user-confirmation guard in docstrings).

# See docs: "Tools" — tool types, @tool decorator, risk levels
#
# This module mirrors tools/confluence.py exactly — same 5-tool shape (search,
# read page, list a container, create, update) plus a recent-activity helper for
# Daily Standup. Read tools are low-risk (fetch page text for the LLM to reason
# about during project analysis); write tools (create_page, update_page) are
# high-risk and carry an explicit "only call after user confirms" docstring note.
#
# Why notion-client?
# The official notion-client package wraps the Notion REST API with typed methods,
# handles the required Notion-Version header, and mirrors how the rest of the
# project talks to external services through a per-integration SDK
# (atlassian-python-api for Confluence/Jira, PyGithub for GitHub). This keeps the
# auth + client-creation model consistent and avoids raw REST calls.
#
# Auth: Notion uses its OWN integration token (NOTION_TOKEN) — unlike Confluence,
# which reuses Jira's Atlassian credentials. The only optional extra is
# NOTION_ROOT_PAGE_ID (a page/database ID used as the default create parent and to
# scope the standup feed) — Notion has no "space key" concept.
#
# ONE real divergence from Confluence: Notion has no single storage-format "body"
# to overwrite, so notion_update_page APPENDS content blocks (and can rename the
# page) rather than replacing the whole body like confluence_update_page.
