"""Native chat routes — the planning conversation over HTTP.

One turn is a chunked NDJSON stream: each line is a typed event from
:mod:`yeaboi.agent.chat_session`, terminated by ``done`` or ``error``.
Loopback has no proxy buffering, so a stream is simply the right shape — the
long-poll rationale that shaped the board servers does not apply here.

The turn runs on a worker thread and the generator drains its queue, because
``ChatSession.send`` calls back synchronously and a generator cannot yield
from inside a callback. The turn lock and the operation entry are released in
the generator's ``finally``, so a disconnected client frees them too.
