"""The three actions every result screen carries: Export, Share, Anonymize.

They are one module because they are one gesture with three destinations — take
the artifact this screen is showing and send it somewhere — and because all
three start the same way: resolve a ``(kind, session_id, run_id)`` reference back
into the stored artifact (:mod:`yeaboi.sharing.resolve`).

What each one is:

* **Export** writes Markdown + HTML to disk, or publishes to Notion/Confluence.
  ``copy`` is answered as data rather than performed — a clipboard belongs to
  whatever is in front of the person, not to a background process.
* **Share** publishes the artifact behind an access code for as long as the
  host leaves it open, correctable when the kind allows it. The lifecycle lives
  in :class:`~yeaboi.app.supervisor.BoardSupervisor`, so a reloaded window
  rejoins the share it left.
* **Anonymize** runs the masking pass and returns the replacement map. The
  *surface* applies it, exactly as the terminal does: masking is a view over the
  same data, never a second copy of it.

Artifact corrections have MCP tools already (``artifact_fields``,
``artifact_edit_history``, ``artifact_edit_apply``); what is native here is the
one read an editor panel opens with — the fields for a kind and the corrections
already recorded against a specific artifact, in a single call.
