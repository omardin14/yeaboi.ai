"""The desktop backend server.

A ``ThreadingHTTPServer`` like the board servers, and for the same reason: the
standard library is the only web server that ships with every install. What
sits on top differs — a route table instead of an if-chain, and a bearer token
instead of a query token (see ``auth.py``).

Headers come from ``web/security.py``, the only module allowed to decide them.
:class:`AppServer` is kept separate from the HTTP plumbing so the whole
surface can be driven in tests by calling :meth:`AppServer.handle` with a
:class:`Request` — no socket, no port, no thread.
