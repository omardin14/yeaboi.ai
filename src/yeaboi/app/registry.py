"""The declarative route table — the desktop surface's discovery source.

Every native route the backend serves is one row here, and
:func:`build_router` is the only thing that turns rows into a live
:class:`~yeaboi.app.router.Router`. That makes this module the Python-side
parity anchor: ``tests/unit/test_surface_parity.py``'s desktop column (landing
with the renderer milestone) checks two-way against ``ROUTES`` plus the MCP
dispatcher's tool inventory, so a route added here without a capability — or a
capability claiming a route that does not exist — fails the build.

``capability`` names the ``CAPABILITIES`` row a route belongs to; ``None``
marks pure infrastructure (health, events, shutdown) that no capability owns.
