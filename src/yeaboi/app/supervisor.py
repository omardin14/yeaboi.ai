"""Live boards and temporary shares, owned by the backend rather than a window.

The TUI's boards live inside a frame loop: the page opens the server, brings the
link up, draws, and tears both down in a ``finally``. A desktop window cannot own
them that way — a reload would kill a retro mid-ceremony — so the sessions live
here, in the process that outlives every window, and a surface holds nothing but
an id.

Two kinds of session, and the difference is what they are for:

* a **board** (retro, poker) is a live collaborative surface with a join code;
  closing it flushes the board to its mode's store, because the ceremony that
  just happened is the artifact.
* a **share** is one finished artifact published behind an access code, and
  closing it decides whether the corrections teammates made are kept.

``stop_all`` runs at shutdown so a tunnel never outlives the app.
