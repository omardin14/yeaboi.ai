"""Native board routes — starting a retro or poker board, and hosting it.

The board itself is served by the mode's own loopback server on its own port;
these routes are the *host controls* around it. A surface starts a board, polls
its snapshot while the ceremony runs, retries the secure link if it failed, and
closes it — which is also what flushes the ceremony to its mode's store.

A snapshot carries no secret. The host link — which holds the admin token that
makes its holder the host — is served only by ``GET /api/boards/{id}/host``,
because exactly one caller opens the board window and everything else that
draws a board would only be carrying the token around.

Poker setup is two calls, not one: ``GET /api/poker/options`` answers what this
machine can offer, ``POST /api/poker/tickets`` fetches a scope, and the ticket
list is passed to ``POST /api/boards/poker``. Splitting it that way is what lets
a surface show the tickets before committing the table to them.
