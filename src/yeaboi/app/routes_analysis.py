"""Native team-analysis routes — the setup options, the run, and a saved result.

``team_analyze`` and ``team_roster`` are MCP tools, so a headless caller already
has them. What lives here is what MCP has no shape for: what this machine is
configured to offer a setup wizard, a run that reports progress and can be
stopped while it works, and a stored profile with the cards it earned.

A run is a chunked NDJSON stream: ``op`` first, then ``progress`` lines drained
off the engine's shared list, then ``done`` with the result. Cancelling the op
sets the engine's ``cancel_event``, which aborts queued jobs at pickup and
raises before anything is persisted.
