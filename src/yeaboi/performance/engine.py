"""Performance engine — 1:1 prep, 1:1 completion, and 6-month review pipelines.

Like the standup engine, these are standalone pipelines (NOT LangGraph nodes):
each is one deterministic gather step + a single LLM call following the same
parse → fallback → format convention the graph nodes use (agent/nodes.py). An LLM
auth/billing failure is never re-raised — it becomes a user-facing *warning* and a
deterministic fallback artifact, so the page always renders something useful.

Pipelines:
  run_one_on_one_prep(engineer)   → gather sprint activity + carried actions → LLM → OneOnOnePrep
  complete_one_on_one(engineer, transcript) → LLM → OneOnOneRecord → email (SMTP) → store
  run_six_month_review(engineer)  → gather 1:1s + delivery + ceremony + notes → LLM → SixMonthReview

# See docs: "The ReAct Loop" — using the LLM outside the main graph
# See docs: "Prompt Construction" — the performance prompts
