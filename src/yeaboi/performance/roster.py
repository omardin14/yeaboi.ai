"""Build the engineer roster for Performance mode from Jira / Azure DevOps.

The roster is the list of *real people who did work* — we derive it from the
assignees on recently-updated tickets, not from the plan's team-size number. This
reuses the same recent-activity helpers the Daily Standup collector uses
(``jira_recent_activity`` / ``azdevops_recent_activity``), so there is no new API
surface to maintain and the roster reflects who is actually active on the board.

Tool helpers are imported lazily (optional SDKs), same convention as
standup/collector.py and standup/sprint_context.py. Everything degrades to an
empty roster on missing config / auth failure — the page then shows a clear
"connect Jira or Azure DevOps" hint instead of crashing.

# See README: "Daily Standup" — recent-activity collection
# See README: "Tools" — Jira, Azure DevOps
