"""Everything this product already knows about one engineer, gathered per person.

Performance used to reason from tracker tickets alone. Every other mode has been
quietly recording the rest: standup persists a per-member view of their code,
documentation and self-reported updates; analysis scores their practice hygiene;
retro and poker record what they wrote and how they estimated; reporting records
what shipped. This reads all of it back for one person.

Design mirrors ``poker/context.py`` — the codebase's existing cross-mode gatherer:
one graceful I/O entry point that NEVER raises (a missing DB, an empty table or a
broken store just means less evidence), plus pure deterministic helpers that are
trivially unit-testable. Saved stores are read first because they cost nothing;
the network is touched only to fill a stretch nothing has covered, and only when
the caller asks for it.

**Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.** Every source reports its own
coverage, including the case where runs exist but none of them matched this
engineer's aliases — that is an attribution gap, not a quiet day. The prompt is
told the difference; without that a review can say someone wrote no tests when
the truth is nobody ever scanned a repository.
