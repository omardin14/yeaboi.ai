"""The live, in-memory retro board — the single source of truth during a session.

A retro is collaborative: while the host's TUI is open, teammates POST cards from
their browsers (retro/server.py) on background HTTP threads, and the TUI render
loop reads the board every frame on the main thread. Two-thread access means the
card list MUST be guarded — ``RetroBoard`` owns one ``threading.Lock`` and is the
only object that ever touches ``_cards``.

Concurrency contract (see plan "Concurrency / shutdown checklist"):
  * ``_cards`` is only ever mutated while holding ``_lock``.
  * Readers take a *copy* of the list inside the lock, then work on the copy
    outside — the lock is never held across a Rich render or a JSON dump.
  * ``_revision`` is bumped on every mutation, giving both the browser poller and
    the TUI an O(1) "did anything change?" check.

The frozen, serializable artifacts (``RetroCard``, ``RetroReport``) live in
agent/state.py alongside StandupReport; this module owns only the mutable live
object and the board → report snapshot.
