"""Optional public tunnel for the Retro board — off-network joining, zero setup.

The LAN server (retro/server.py) only reaches teammates on the same network. To
let a remote teammate join, the host can start a **Cloudflare quick tunnel**,
which exposes ``http://localhost:<port>`` at a random ``https://…trycloudflare.com``
URL. Crucially this needs **no Cloudflare account, no token, no signup** — so the
app can own the whole flow: it downloads the ``cloudflared`` binary on first use
(cached under ``~/.scrum-agent/bin/``) and runs it. (ngrok, by contrast, forces a
per-user authtoken, so it can't be truly zero-setup.)

The tunnel forwards to our existing token-gated server, so ``/api/*`` stays
protected; the public URL simply carries the same ``?token=`` the LAN URL does,
now over HTTPS. This turns the retro into "anyone with the link can join" — fine
for a retrospective, but it is internet-reachable while the tunnel is up.

Everything here is best-effort and never raises into the TUI: a failed download
or tunnel start returns ``None`` / a status string, and the retro keeps working
on the LAN.
