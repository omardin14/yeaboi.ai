"""The context flow — what each mode leaves for the others inside a project.

One fact table for every surface that explains a project: the TUI's Projects
page draws it as a strip; the desktop mirrors it by hand in its
``lib/yeaboi/reads.ts`` (nothing here guards the two — diff them on a change).
``reads`` are the ``CONTEXT_DEP_TOKENS`` a mode consumes (see
``projects/scope.py`` and each engine's scope call site); ``leaves`` is the
one fragment that says what the run leaves behind.
