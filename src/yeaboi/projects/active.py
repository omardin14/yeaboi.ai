Set by the door after the landing split (Projects picks one, Sessions clears
it) and by the welcome screen's ``P`` shortcut; read by mode launch sites
when they invoke an engine, so a standup or report started from the menu
runs scoped without every screen learning about projects. Deliberately
process-local and unpersisted: the active project is a *session* choice, and
a stale one silently rescoping next week's runs is worse than re-picking.
