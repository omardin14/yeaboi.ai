"""Team-analysis engine — the headless pipeline behind the TUI Analysis mode.

# See README: "Architecture" — engines are UI-free pipelines; the TUI, CLI and
# MCP server are thin adapters over them (CLAUDE.md "REQUIRED: Surface Parity").

Design choice — standalone pipeline, not a LangGraph node (same rationale as
``standup/engine.py``): the analysis is a deterministic gather step
(``_fetch_*_history``) followed by the 4-worker parallel analysis in
``tools/team_learning.py`` (which already handles its own LLM calls with
regex fallbacks), so a compiled graph would add checkpointing overhead for
nothing.

Error contract:
- Missing tracker / no closed sprints / fetch failures **raise** — with no
  board there is nothing to analyse, and every caller (TUI worker, CLI, MCP
  ``run_engine``) has its own error surface for that.
- LLM failures never raise: the parsers inside ``_run_parallel_analysis`` fall
  back to regex extraction, and the optional insights/samples steps degrade to
  a ``warnings`` entry.

    saved delivery profile (so the stored-profile browser keeps showing them).

    Args:
        source: 'jira', 'azdevops', or 'both'; blank auto-detects a single

        project_key: tracker project; blank falls back to the configured one.
        team_name: AzDO team name attached to the profile (blank = configured).
        sprint_count: closed sprints to analyse (TUI uses 8).
        generate_samples: also generate auto-accepted sample tickets
            (epic/stories/tasks/sprint) in the team's style — extra LLM calls.
        include_insights: also generate the start/stop/keep/try coaching
            insights (one extra LLM call).
        include_ai_usage: legacy toggle folded into ``components`` when the latter is
            None — scan commits/PRs for AI-tool markers (Code component).
        include_doc_quality: legacy toggle folded into ``components`` when None — read
            recent Notion/Confluence pages (Docs component).
        analysis_depth: ``quick`` makes no LLM calls and uses deterministic
            explanations; ``deep`` adds cached ticket classification and AI-written
            enrichments. Defaults to ``quick``.
        components: component → sub-source map, e.g.
            ``{"delivery": ["jira"], "code": ["github", "azdo"], "docs": ["confluence"]}``.
            Each component runs over ONLY its listed sub-sources; an absent/empty
            component is skipped. ``None`` derives the default from ``source`` + the
            two booleans (delivery over source/both/auto; code/docs over all their
            sub-sources).
        members: per delivery-tracker subset of assignee names, e.g.
            ``{"jira": ["Alice", "Bob"]}`` — re-scopes that tracker's velocity/
            contributors. The single global code scan filters commit authors by the
            union of all selected members. Blank/missing = whole team.
        progress: optional shared list the analysis workers append status
            strings to (the TUI reads it from its frame loop).
        db_path: sessions DB override (tests). Defaults to paths.get_db_path().

    Raises ValueError when nothing at all can be analysed (no tracker/component
    configured); per-tracker board errors degrade to a ``warnings`` entry.
