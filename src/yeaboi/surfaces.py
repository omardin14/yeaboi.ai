"""The surfaces a piece of user-facing copy can be true on.

One vocabulary, shared by the release notes (:mod:`yeaboi.changelog`) and the
discoverability tips (:mod:`yeaboi.ui.shared._tips`): the terminal app + CLI, the
Electron desktop app, and the browser-served share/board pages. Copy that names a
gesture belongs to the surface that has it; copy that describes the product
belongs to all of them.
