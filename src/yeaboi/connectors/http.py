A connector's base URL can be user-owned — self-hosted Grafana, self-hosted
Sentry — which makes it an SSRF vector the LLM-facing tools never had: those
talk to fixed vendor hosts. :func:`assert_safe_url` is what stands between a
stored setting and a request to the cloud metadata endpoint.

Credentials never reach a log or a message from here: transport exceptions go
through the same redaction ``provider_verification._connection_error`` uses.
