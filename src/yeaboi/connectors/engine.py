"""The connector catalog, as every surface reads it.

Deliberately ONE public entry point: ``test_surface_parity`` globs
``*/engine.py`` and forces every public name here into the capability registry,
so the query helpers live in ``registry.py`` and the shapes in ``spec.py``.

Verification is deliberately absent. ``settings.engine.verify_connection`` is
already registered on every surface and already owns the credential semantics
(stored-value fallback, the exfiltration guard, https-only); once its table is
registry-derived, a new connector is verifiable everywhere for free.

The second entry point, :func:`fetch_ops_events`, is the read side of the same
capability: the catalog says what is connected, this says what it saw.
