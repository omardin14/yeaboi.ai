"""What one integration *is*, as data.

Every fact a surface needs about a connector lives on the descriptor: which env
vars it reads, which of them are secret, how it verifies, which settings section
it renders under, and the glyph/accent it wears. The registries that used to
hold those facts separately — the settings fields, the verify table, the secret
lists, the TUI section builders — derive from here instead of restating it.

Stdlib-only at import time: ``settings/engine.py`` imports this at module scope,
and that module is on the startup path for every surface.
