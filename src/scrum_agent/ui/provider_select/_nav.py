"""Section navigation for the setup wizard's step state machine.

# See README: "Architecture" — the setup wizard (``select_provider``) is a step
# state machine that, by default, runs LLM Provider → Issue Tracking → Docs →
# Version Control in order. This module lets the user move between those sections
# with the ← / → arrow keys (a "tab bar" over the progress chips) and finish from
# anywhere with F, instead of only advancing linearly.
#
# The mechanism is a small sentinel: a phase's picker loop calls ``nav_for_key``
# on each keypress and, when it returns a ``StepNav``, hands that back to the main
# loop instead of a result dict. The main loop then jumps to ``target`` (or
# returns the collected config when ``finish`` is set). The LLM step stays a
# required gate — the master config dict is seeded from the provider + key — so
# free movement is offered only once the LLM step is done.
