"""Performance mode — per-engineer 1:1 prep, 1:1 completion, and 6-month reviews.

A team lead picks an engineer (roster derived from Jira / Azure DevOps assignees)
and runs one of three connected workflows. The 1:1 Prep ↔ Completion loop closes
via action items; the whole store feeds Planning & Analysis via
``gather_performance_context`` so the system becomes person-aware.

Public API is re-exported here; submodules lazy-import their optional/heavy deps
(LLM, tracker SDKs) inside functions, so importing this package is always cheap and
safe — mirrors the standup / retro packages.
