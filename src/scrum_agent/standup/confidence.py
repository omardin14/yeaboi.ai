"""Deterministic sprint-day and confidence scoring for Daily Standup mode.

No LLM is involved here — confidence is pure arithmetic over the sprint's ideal
burn-down, so it's cheap, fast, and unit-testable. The engine calls compute()
and drops the result straight onto the StandupReport.

Model:
- Sprint day = working days elapsed since the sprint start (Mon-Fri, minus
  bank holidays), 1-indexed, capped at the sprint's total working days.
- Confidence = actual completed points vs the *ideal linear burn* for the day.
  On day D of a T-day sprint with capacity C, you'd ideally have burned
  C * D / T points. completed / ideal → a ratio, bucketed into On track /
  At risk / Behind. A dead-quiet sprint (no recent activity past day 1) is
  nudged down because silence usually means stalled work.
