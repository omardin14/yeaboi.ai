"""Curated golden dataset project descriptions for regression testing.

Each dataset is a dict with:
- ``description``: Rich project description (used as Q1 answer)
- ``answers``: Full Q1–Q26 answer set for the questionnaire
- ``expected``: Structural expectations for artifact validation

These datasets drive the full pipeline (analyzer → features → stories → tasks →
sprints) and assert structural properties of the output — not exact text,
since LLM outputs vary across runs.
