"""Golden dataset regression tests — structural evaluators for pipeline output.

Runs each curated project through the full pipeline (analyzer → features → stories
→ tasks → sprints) with mocked LLM responses that return structurally valid but
deterministic JSON. Validates structural properties of the output:

- Feature count within bounds
- Story-to-feature relationships valid
- Story points are Fibonacci values
- Acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
- Task-to-story references valid
- Sprint allocation covers all stories without exceeding velocity

These tests catch regressions in parsing, validation, and fallback logic.
They do NOT test LLM quality — for that, use LangSmith evaluators with real
API calls.

Run with: ``make eval`` or ``pytest tests/golden/ -v``
