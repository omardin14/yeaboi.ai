"""The `_duck_mascot` panel stamps that steer the chrome's mascot family.

MusicLive.get_renderable reads this attribute off every frame's renderable and
draws the corner companion / entrance / screensaver in that family — Agents
surfaces must stamp "robo", everything else must stay unstamped (duck).
