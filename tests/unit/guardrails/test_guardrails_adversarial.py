"""Adversarial input coverage for the guardrail stack.

# See README: "Guardrails" — three lines of defence, human-in-the-loop pattern

Extension of test_input_guardrails.py focused on realistic attack scenarios
rather than individual function contracts.

What this adds over test_input_guardrails.py
--------------------------------------------
* **Injection** — comprehensive parametrized list of real-world jailbreak
  variants (more phrasing permutations than the per-pattern unit tests),
  legitimate project descriptions that contain injection-adjacent words,
  and injection embedded mid-paragraph.
* **Length** — realistic accident scenarios: pasted Python file, pasted JSON
  config blob, deliberate repetition-padding attack.
* **Gibberish / non-English** — keyboard-mash and non-English-script inputs
  that fail the allowlist, 8 off-topic social questions blocked by the
  mocked classifier, and non-English answers that contain tech terms and
  should pass the allowlist without any classifier call.
