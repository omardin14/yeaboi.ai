"""Unit tests for the cross-mode per-engineer evidence gatherer.

Two properties matter more than the rest and are pinned hardest:

* **Attribution** — one person's work, and nobody else's, reaches their artifact.
* **Coverage honesty** — a source that was never scanned must never read as an
  engineer who did nothing. Every source says which of the two it is.
