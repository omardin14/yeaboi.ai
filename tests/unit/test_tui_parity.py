"""TUI parity — the constructs beneath a capability must reach the desktop too.

``test_surface_parity.py`` asks a coarse question: does this capability exist on
every surface? It is the right question for a mode, and the wrong one for the
things a mode is made of. A settings section, a slash command, a keyboard
gesture — none of them is a capability, and all of them can land in the terminal
alone without a single parity row noticing.

So this file is the second registry, and it works the way the first one does:
discover the terminal's own tables (never a hand-copy of them), hold them
against the desktop's committed manifest, and fail two-way. What the desktop
deliberately does differently is named in ``TERMINAL_ONLY`` with the reason —
and the reason has to be a real one, because every entry here exists because a
terminal could not do the ordinary thing and a window can.

This is the file the M12 parity flip added. The rollout ledger it retires — the
``Exempt("desktop: scheduled milestone M<n>")`` rows each milestone burned down
— is now closed by :class:`TestTheRolloutIsOver`: a scheduled exemption cannot
come back, because there is nothing left to schedule.
