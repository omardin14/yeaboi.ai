"""Live-TUI smoke test: boot ``yeaboi --dry-run`` in a real pseudo-terminal.

Every other TUI test drives screen builders and key handlers with StringIO
consoles and fake key callables — none of them exercise the *live* terminal
path (raw mode, alt-screen, mouse tracking, real control sequences). That is
exactly the surface a dependency bump (e.g. ``rich``) can break without any
unit test noticing, so this test guards the auto-merged dependency pipeline:
it launches the real CLI in a pty, waits for the mode-select screen to render,
sends ``q``, and asserts a clean exit.

Skipped on Windows (no ``pty``); marked ``slow`` like the other integration
tests that pay real startup cost (the splash animation alone is ~2s).
