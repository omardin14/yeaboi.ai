"""Graph topology validation — structural integrity checks for the agent graph.

# See README: "Agentic Blueprint Reference" — Core Graph Setup, Wiring

These tests catch wiring mistakes (orphan nodes, dead ends, dangling edge targets)
that would break the agent at runtime but are not always caught by LangGraph's
own compile-time validation:

- ``TestNodeReachability``   — every node is reachable from START (no orphans)
- ``TestNodeOutgoingEdges``  — every node has at least one outgoing edge
- ``TestConditionalEdges``   — all conditional edge targets are registered nodes
- ``TestCompileTimeGuardrails`` — what LangGraph does and does not enforce itself

All tests call ``create_graph(tools=[])`` so no LLM / API key is needed.
