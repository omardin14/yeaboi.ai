**Best friend to engineers and agents — plans, standups, retros, performance & reporting for your team, plus cost, recoverable spend and security posture for the AI agents working alongside it. All from your terminal.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install (it brings its own Python)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://yeaboi.ai/install.sh | sh
yeaboi --setup                  # configure your API key
yeaboi                          # launch the interactive TUI
```

**You do not need to install Python first.** The script installs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
if it is missing, then gives yeaboi its own isolated environment on a Python that uv downloads —
so whatever is (or isn't) on your machine does not matter. It writes only under your home
directory and never uses `sudo`. Read it first if you like: [`install.sh`](https://yeaboi.ai/install.sh).

macOS and Linux. On Windows, install inside [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install) —
the terminal UI needs a POSIX terminal.

<details>
<summary><b>Other ways to install</b></summary>

```bash
uv tool install yeaboi                       # already have uv
uvx yeaboi                                   # try it without installing
pipx install --python 3.12 --fetch-missing-python yeaboi
pip install yeaboi                           # needs Python 3.10+ already present
```

`uv tool install` fetches a Python for you if none on the machine qualifies. **`pipx` and `pip`
do not** — they use the interpreter they are run with, which is why the flags above are needed
and why the `curl` line is the one to give someone who just wants to see the product.

`uvx yeaboi` runs without installing anything permanent; your API key and sessions still live in
`~/.yeaboi`, so `yeaboi --setup` persists across runs.

</details>

> **Note on names:** the package was previously published as **`scrum-agent`**. It is now **`yeaboi`** on PyPI, matching the command. A final `scrum-agent` release remains as a thin redirect that installs `yeaboi`, and the legacy `scrum-agent` command still works as an alias for that release — but new installs should use `yeaboi`.

**Voice input needs no separate install.** Double-tap Space in any text field and yeaboi
offers to set dictation up in place — it installs the packages into the environment it is
already running in, downloads the speech model with a progress bar, and drops straight
into recording. No restart, no second terminal. (`yeaboi --install-voice` does the same
thing headlessly, for CI and dev containers.)

It is kept out of the base install rather than bundled because the speech engine
(`ctranslate2`, `onnxruntime`) publishes wheels only for 64-bit macOS, glibc ≥ 2.28 Linux
and Windows — making it a hard dependency would break `pip install yeaboi` outright on
Alpine/musl, older glibc, 32-bit and armv7 hosts. On those platforms yeaboi says so
instead of offering an install that cannot work.

Optional extras can still be requested at install time if you prefer:

```bash
uv tool install "yeaboi[voice]"                # 🎤 dictation, pre-installed rather than on demand
uv tool install "yeaboi[all-providers]"        # OpenAI, Google, Bedrock, Ollama + the six OpenAI-wire vendors
pipx install --python 3.12 --fetch-missing-python "yeaboi[voice]"   # equivalent with pipx
```

> **Voice input** transcribes on-device with [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)
> — **no API key**, works with every LLM provider (Anthropic, Bedrock, …). On **macOS/Windows** it is
> fully self-contained (the `sounddevice` wheel bundles PortAudio). On **Linux**, also install the
> system library: `sudo apt install libportaudio2` — yeaboi will not run `sudo` for you. A small
> Whisper model downloads on first use (~140 MB for the default `base`; set `VOICE_MODEL` to
> `tiny`/`small`/`medium`/`large-v3` to trade size for accuracy).

> **Homebrew is not supported.** A required dependency (`sqlite-vec`) ships no
> source distribution, which Homebrew's source-build model can't handle, so
> `brew install yeaboi` is intentionally disabled. Use the `curl` line or
> `uv tool install` above instead.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeaboi-ai/yeaboi.ai.git
cd yeaboi.ai
make install        # installs uv, creates venv, installs dependencies
make env            # creates .env from .env.example — add your API key
make run            # launch the CLI
```

### Headless / CI mode

```bash
yeaboi --non-interactive --description "Build a todo app" --output json
yeaboi --non-interactive --description @project-brief.txt --output html --team-size 5
```
